# WordScapes-Bot-1.1
Faster version of WordScapesBot1.0

Not much to say here...

Just like the first WordScapes Bot 1.0, this was just supposed to be a fun project
to learn and get better at cpp. Any constructive feedback would be nice
(sorry if my code looks very bad/messy).

I sped up the wordscapesbot by splitting the dictionary text document into a - z
(there is a text document "a.txt" that has all letters that start with the letter "a" and so on an so forth)

Again, idrc what you do with my code. I still don't understand the whole licensing thing, but you can do whatever you want with my code
copy, delete, change, etc. I don't care.
